						Interconnect architectures
					</h2>
					<p>
						An interconnect is a basic building block of any SoC's on-chip communication architecture.
						The interconnect is the connection between multiple master/slave IP blocks inside SoC.
						A typical basic example of an interconnect is a single shared bus. This is the simplest
						on-chip communication architecture, consisting of several shared, parallel wires to which 
						various components are connected.
						Only one component on the bus can have the control of the shared wires at any given time
						to perform transfers. This limits the parallelism and achievable performance in the system,
						which makes it unsuitable for modern SoC that can have tens to hundreds of components.
						Consequently, the single shared bus architecture is not scalable to meet the demands of SoC
						applications.
					</p>
					<p>
						Typical shared-bus interconnect architectures are:
						<ul>
							<li>Hierarchical bus</li>
							<li>Ring bus</li>
							<li>Ad-hoc bus</li>
							<li>Crossbar (bus matrix)</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						A <i>hierarchical</i> shared bus architecture consists of a hierarchy of buses interconnected using
						bridge components. Shared buses higher up in the hierarchy are typically operated at higher 
						clock frequencies, and are used to connect high speed, high performance components.
						On the other hand, shared buses lower down in the hierarchy
						are operated at lower frequencies to save power, and connect high latency, low
						performance components.
					</p>

							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<br>
					<p>
						A <i>ring</i> bus is actually a set of unidirectional, concentric
						and pipelined buses which allow high frequency operation and high bandwidth
						transfers between components on the bus.
					</p>

					<table class="bordered-table" align="center" style="float: none">

							<tr>
								<td>
									<img src="img/ring-bus.png" alt="" width="500">
								</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<br>
					<p>
						An <i>ad-hoc</i> bus architecture contains buses being operated at different 
						frequencies and the components can have point-to-point links with each other, as needed.
					</p>

					<table class="bordered-table" align="center" style="float: none">

									<img src="img/adhoc-bus.png" alt="" width="500">

							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<br>

					<p>
						A Crossbar bus is a matrix a combination of shared bus and point-to-point interconnections.
					</p>
					<table class="bordered-table" align="center" style="float: none">

						Interconnect constituents
					</h2>
						<p>Each bus-based interconenct is defined by its two major constituents:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>topology</li>
							<li>protocol parameters</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The <i>topology</i> of a communication refers to how the buses are interconencted together, 
							and how each component is mapped to others. The <i>protocol parameters</i> refer to arbitration schemes,
							bus widths, bus clock frequencies, buffer sizes, burst transfer sizes, which are specific to
							the protocol communication architecture.
